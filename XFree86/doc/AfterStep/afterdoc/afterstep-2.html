<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Where do I get AfterStep?</A>
</H2>

<P>The main AfterStep resources on the net are below.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>WWW Page

<P>The official WWW page is at 
<A HREF="http://www.afterstep.org">http://www.afterstep.org</A><P>Alas, it is way too old; but as of this writing is being updated by a new Web
team.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>FTP Site

<P>The FTP site, 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.afterstep.org/pub/">ftp://ftp.afterstep.org/pub/</A>, is the best place to
get AfterStep. It also supports uploads:
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.afterstep.org/incoming/">ftp://ftp.afterstep.org/incoming/</A>.
A link to the FTP site is provided from the Web site.

<P>There are also some useful things to be found on the following two pages.  The
first is the current, official AfterStep Customization Page; go to it if you're
looking for really useful stuff.  The second is rather out of date, but still
nice-looking, and possibly useful:

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 What is the latest version of AfterStep?</A>
</H2>

<P>The latest public version is 1.4.5, released on April 1998.
In Summer 1998, version 2.0 should be available.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 I've compiled AfterStep for my system but every time I try to use it I</A>
receive the message: Cannot open display. What should I do?</H2>

<P>AfterStep is an X window manager and cannot be run from the terminal.
It must be run through X.  The easiest way to do that is to either
create or edit your own  .xinitrc file (which contains a list of the
programs you wish to load upon startup) and add the line exec
afterstep to the end.  This last exec'd line is significant in that it
says to shut down X when that program is terminated.  Now that you
have that file, simply startup X in your customary manner, most likely
startx or xinit.  Now you're off and running.  Good luck!  
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 How can I install AfterStep without being root?</A>
</H2>

<P>This is fairly easy. You will have to install all the files under your
home directory. The usual recommendation is to use the same
directories as suggested in the installation procedure, but replacing
/usr/local by your home directory. For example, if you home directory
is  /home/blah you would use directories like /home/blah/bin,
/home/blah/etc,  /home/blah/lib, etc.
<P>Compile AfterStep following the manual installation procedure until the
install step. Then, do the following (make sure to create the
destination directories first if they don't exist. All the source
paths are relative to the AfterStep source directory):
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Copy  afterstep/afterstep to  $HOME/bin/.</LI>
<LI> Copy  modules/*/(binaries) to  $HOME/bin/.</LI>
<LI> Copy  apps/*/(binaries) to  $HOME/bin/.</LI>
<LI> Copy  GNUstep/ to  $HOME/.</LI>
<LI> Edit  $HOME/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/base.* to reflect the above paths
in the lines starting with ModulePath and PixmapPath.</LI>
<LI> Put  $HOME/bin in your path.</LI>
</OL>
<P>You should be set. Feel free to modify this procedure according to
your particular needs or the particular setup of your machine/account.
