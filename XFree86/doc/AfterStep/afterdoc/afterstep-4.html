<H2><A NAME="s4">4. AfterStep Configuration</A></H2>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 What's a .steprc, and why do I need it anyway?</A>
</H2>

<P>In versions of AfterStep prior to version 1.2, all configuration is handled
in a single file.  This is the .steprc file; it should be in your home
directory if you're running these versions.  New versions of AfterStep don't
use this file, preferring the GNUstep/Library standard instead.  See below.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 I'm using AfterStep 1.4, and I can't find the .steprc.  Why?</A>
</H2>

<P>AfterStep now uses a directory structure to handle desktop customization. 
Versions through 1.4 need a full set of directories in each user's home
directory.  In other words, you need to copy everything in
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[AfterStepPath]/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>to
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There were several changes to this directory structure between version 1.4.0
and 1.4.4; these changes are beyond the scope of this document.  But for
help configuring 1.4.4, see :
<A HREF="http://www.via.ayuda.com/~smw/afterstep/configs/index.html">http://www.via.ayuda.com/~smw/afterstep/configs/index.html</A>.
<P>The &nbsp/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep arrangement is, admittedly, somewhat
inefficient, because there are always at least two copies of everything on any
system running AfterStep.
As of version post 1.4.5, it is possible to add only those files which you have
changed to the directory structure in your home directory, and everything else
uses the default installation in /usr/share/afterstep.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 What are "look", "feel", "desktop", etc. files?</A>
</H2>

<P>The various elements of the desktop have been separated out, in order that they
can each be customized independently.  Look files and feel files allow you to
customize the desktop in almost an infinite number of ways.  Note that any
functional changes you make in a look file (like adjusting the number of
buttons that appear on a window titlebar) must also be reflected in a
corresponding feel file: the "feel" handles how you interact with windows,
while the "look" controls their appearance.  This is handy if you want your
windows always to respond in more or less the same way, but want them to look
differently depending on the task you're performing, the machine you're on, or
whatever.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 I hate the &nbsp/GNUstep/* hierarchy.  Why can't I have my .steprc in</A>
version 1.4.x?</H2>

<P>You can.  Use the -f switch to force AfterStep to read from a file.  Please
notice that not everything will work with your old .steprc file "right out
of the box"; but if you like the old version that much, why upgrade anyway?
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 I'm using RedHat, and I can't find the configuration files you've mentioned.</A>
</H2>

<P>RedHat apparently includes a look-alike to AfterStep which is actually a
hack of fvwm-2.  <EM>It is not AfterStep</EM>, although some RH distributions
also contain the real AfterStep.  RedHat has, as of this writing, agreed to
change the name of their "hacked" version, in order to reduce confusion, and
include the real AfterStep in post 5.0 releases.
