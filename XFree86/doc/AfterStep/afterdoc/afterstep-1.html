<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 What is AfterStep?</A>
</H2>

<P>AfterStep is a Window Manager for X which started by emulating the NEXTSTEP
look and feel, but which has been significantly altered according to the
requests of various users.  Many adepts will tell you that NEXTSTEP is not only
the most visually pleasant interface, but also one of the most functional and
intuitive out there.  AfterStep aims to incorporate the advantages of the
NEXTSTEP interface, and add additional useful features.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 What is its history?</A>
</H2>

<P>From the man page:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
       AfterStep is a continuation of the BowMan window manager
       which was originally put together by Bo Yang.  BowMan was
       based on the fvwm window manager, written by Robert Nation.
       fvwm was based on code from twm.  And so on...  It is
       designed to emulate some of the look and feel of the
       NEXTSTEP user interface, while adding useful, requested, and
       neat features.  The changes which comprise AfterStep person-
       ality were originally part of BowMan development, but due to
       a desire to move past simple emulation and into a niche as
       its own valuable window manager, the current designers
       decided to change the project name and move on.  BowMan
       development may continue, but we will no longer be a part of
       it.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 What are its main features?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<OL>
<LI> NEXTSTEP-alike title bar, title buttons, borders and corners.</LI>
<LI> The AfterStep Wharf, which is a much worked-out version of GoodStuff. To
avoid copyright complications it is not called a `dock.'</LI>
<LI> NEXTSTEP style menus.  The menus are not, however, controlled by
applications; they are more of pop-up service lists on the root
window.</LI>
<LI> NEXTSTEP style icons. The default icons are consistent with those
in the NEXTSTEP interface, but they are configurable.</LI>
<LI> Pixmapped Pager with desktop pixmapping</LI>
<LI> Easy to use look files, to share you desktop appearance with your friends</LI>
<LI> Start menu entries in a hierarchy of directories</LI>
<LI> WinList : a tasklist which can be horizontal or vertical</LI>
<LI> Many modules & asapps to give a good look to your X window station</LI>
</OL>
<P>The flexibility of fvwm was not traded off.  Initiation files recognize most of
the fvwm 1.24r commands. Virtual screens and the pager are still intact.
Modules for fvwm-1.x should work just fine.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 Is it compatible with fvwm-2?</A>
</H2>

<P>Compatibility with fvwm-2 & enlightenment *modules* is planned for version 2.0, but support is not yet available.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 Where can I get this FAQ?</A>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.6">1.6 Who contributes to this FAQ?</A>
</H2>

<P>The initial version of the FAQ was written by Frank Fejes (<CODE>frank@ssax.com</CODE>)
and Jonathan B. Leffert (<CODE>j-leffert@uchicago.edu</CODE>).  Major additions were
made by Kragen Sittler (<CODE>kragen@tcsi.com</CODE>).  Diego Zamboni
(<CODE>zamboni@cs.purdue.edu</CODE>) maintained the file until Guyhelm Aznar
(<CODE>guylhem@oeil.qc.ca</CODE>) took over with the release of AS 1.4.  The file is
now maintained by Andrew Sullivan (<CODE>asullivan@sprint.ca</CODE>). Most of the
questions and answers have been provided by the people participating in the
AfterStep mailing lists.  See the next question for more information on the
lists.
