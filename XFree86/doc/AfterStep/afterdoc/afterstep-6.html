<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 How do I get multiple Wharfs/Pagers on the screen?</A>
</H2>

<P>                                      
It's pretty easy. You just have to have the Wharf exist under several different
names, and then configure each of them using its name. For example, if you make
a link to  Wharf called  MyWharf (type man ln if you don't know how to make
links), you would use lines like these in your
&nbsp/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/wharf file :
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
       *MyWharfAnimate
       *MyWharf &quot;label&quot; Icon.xpm Exec &quot;something&quot; something
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Same for the Pager.
<P>Note: Apparently, due to the way the Wharf configuration file parser works,
links with names like  Wharf2 (i.e. the same original name with characters
appended to it) will not work: the parser will think you are referring to the
original module and will get confused.  You have to give each link a
distinctive name.

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 How can I get ASclock to appear properly in Wharf?</A>
</H2>

<P>First, you need AfterStep 0.98 beta 4 or later. These version have the
MaxSwallow option. Then, add a command such as this to the wharf file or line
(depending on whether you use .steprc):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
         *Wharf asclock nil MaxSwallow &quot;asclock&quot; asclock -12 -shape &
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You can omit the `-12' to be in 24 hour time.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 How do I configure asclock to use fewer colors? </A>
</H2>

<P>When installing, after executing configure, asclock configure should be lauched
by default.  Otherwise, go to the  modules/asclock directory and do the
following:
<OL>
<LI> Execute sh configure</LI>
<LI> Several menus will appear, asking for the default language for dates
(yes, you can change it!) and the number of colors used.  There is one option
to use 2-bit color, resulting in an asclock that uses only 4 colors, but still
looks pretty good.</LI>
<LI> Done. Now go and compile asclock as usual.</LI>
</OL>
