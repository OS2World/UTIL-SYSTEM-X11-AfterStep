<P>Please, please, don't post questions unrelated to AfterStep to the mailing
lists. If you have a problem with some application not running, and you think
AfterStep is the culprit, first try the following:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Read the documentation (manual pages, etc.) for the program.</LI>
<LI> Find out about its configuration parameters (not only command line, but
also options in  .Xdefaults, config files, etc.).</LI>
<LI> Ask other people who know about that specific program. Find a mailing
list about that program and ask there.</LI>
<LI> Try running the program under some other window manager. If it doesn't
work there either, it is not an AfterStep problem.</LI>
</OL>
<P>If you are very confident that it is an AfterStep problem, then send it to the
mailing list, but try to give as much information as possible. Questions like
`Why doesn't blig-graphics work on my system?' do not contain any useful
information that may help others in diagnosing your problem. Some data you may
have to include is:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> AfterStep version you are using.</LI>
<LI> Operating system version, machine architecture.</LI>
<LI> System configuration (color depth, memory, anything you think may help).</LI>
<LI> Problematic program.</LI>
<LI> Environment information (other programs running at the same time, etc.)</LI>
<LI> A detailed description of the problem. What happens (error messages,
etc.), how replicable it is, how to replicate it, etc.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The more information you provide, the easier it will be for others to find a
solution.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 Why am I having `xyz' problem/how do I do `xyz' with a terminal window?</A>
</H2>

<P>Are you using plain vanilla xterm, color xterm, rxvt, rxvt-xpm, vanilla xterm
with Xaw3d or Xaw-Xpm or neXtaw, dtterm, nxterm, hpterm, aixterm, xiterm,
cmdtool, shelltool, or something else?
<P>Note that, while xiterm is now included with the standard AfterStep
distribution, it is not really a part of AfterStep.  Please read the relevant
man pages before posting questions to the list.
