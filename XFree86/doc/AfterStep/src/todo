*****************************************************************************

Modify apps to work perfectly on solaris

Add a second title pixmap that would only reside directly beneath the title
words

Change defaults menus to include '&' shortcuts

Wharf bug : -0 -0 don't work well, you have to use -1 -1 instead

Bug : the little border over titlebars & handlings becomes the same color of
the rootbg time to time.

Wharf : display the label field (currently not used) of a button when the mouse
pointer is over it.

Correct icon label code : if the text needs clipping, the leading part of the
text is removed, instead of the trailing part !!!!

Put all the patches in AS, then check the mixup, especially memory leaks

Add MaxSwallowModule to Wharf (for pagers)

use different options for menus (hilight, text, borders, bg) instead of stdfg
& stdbg ...

support for scaling a pixmap for titlebars and menu items instead of tiling

textured or gradient handles that arent the same as the titlebar

add tile / center option to pager xpm

make asmail use PixmapPath from base file (like wharf & zharf do)

complete StartOnDesk (i.e. Style "xemacs" StartsOnDesk 1 Page 4) so that not
all applications that starts in Desk 1 will start in the top left page.

add option to avoid WinList covers other windows

add option to avoid all XWarpPointers, passed to modules

include nice .xinitrc sample with xmodmap -e "keycode 22 = BackSpace"
& all classical stuff 

make modules use the -f single file

add NO_MULTIPLE_DESKTOPS as compile time option

an intelligent iconbox, 64x64, opening like wharf folders to reduce desktop
usage

Removed linux specific asppp, asrack, astuner & asmodem from standard
distribution ; create patches to make them work on other unices if you want to
find them back here

Add to Pager the feature to show in little windows nonxpm files too ; avoid
unnecessary redraws (especially with big jpegs :)

Add many lacking free(chars ), add more XFreePixmap in Pager.c

Merge ASSound & Audio

Change unix sockets to more X stuff ala XClientMessages

Animate support for Animated Logos (Multiple XPM)

open a little window with window name if mouse stays more than 1 s on window
in the Pager

delete system(), too much unsecure !

Compile time option for SHADE != STICKY

If two directories have the same name, errors were reported : try to fix this

AfterStep support for animated icons (idem)

Press shade, move the window, press window actions -> menu appears
in the old position !!!!

manpages for : asload, asmix, asppp, astuner

fix ßß stuff

use zap/help button to drag windows in the Pager

include nicer sounds & configure Audio module for them !

include ASCP compatible with AF 1.4 in current distribution

use db for 'database' rather than current "Styles" : include a frontend
to add/modify/delete things in this database

include a default database configuration for many common Xprogs, choosing
icons from the ones AF provides, etc.

use windowmaker-like persistent menus

use enlightenment-like pixmaps for windows decoration (titlebar, borders ...)

recode everything in C++ and get rid of original TWM parts & copyright (big
move to full GPL !), then add some scheme as compile time option for dynamic
configuration (like scvwm)

recode wharf to be DND "feedable" + use right click on a icon to configure its
options (command line, name, icon.xpm, ...)

create AfterVoice to talk to AfterStep

use locales

include OpaqueWindowZoom & Rotation, cf. Animate.c  (any demomaker to help ?)

add menuconfig interface for AF's configure.h
(like the one for sunsite's xiterm)

code a *extish  window filemanager

create a asman better & easyier to use than xman (for GetHelp function)
