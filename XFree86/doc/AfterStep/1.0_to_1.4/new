1) New configuration mode


1-1) Directories

Now, everything goes to ~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep or /usr/share/afterstep !

You can use your old .steprc config file with afterstep -f myoldsteprc,
however, this isn't recommended.

New versions of asapps (ie the nice little programs included in apps/) will
also put their config. file here in a near future, like modules currently do.

1-2) AfterStep config. files & colordeph

If your colordepth is 8bpp, files ending by .8bpp will be used, the same for
16bpp & 32bpp : it allows you to have different configuration for color-rich
or color-poor X, different videocards, etc.

1-3) Config. files in this directory


1-3-A) Files you must *not* change

1-3-A1) "autoexec.(yourcolordepth)bpp" will launch several programs at startup;
however, your desktop configuration when you close AfterStep is saved in
~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/.windows (this file is called from autoexec)

1-3-A2) "base.(yourcolordepth)bpp" configures directories where AfterStep, its
modules & its pixmaps are

1-3-A3) "startmenu" is remade everytime you start/restart AfterStep : don't
edit it ! All changes will be lost !

1-3-A4) in "desktop" directory, you mustn't change files in desks/ hierarchy.


YOU SHOULDN'T NEED TO MODIFY THEESE FILES !!!


1-3-B) Files you can change

1-3-B1) "modulesname" configures modules (like Auto, Wharf, Pager, Audio) :
change it the way you like (except Pager background files)

1-3-B2) "start" directory : simply put here files to add to 'Start' menu, for
exemple, creating a file called 'My option' containing 'xedit' will create a
'My option' entry in 'Start' menu, which will lauch 'xedit' when clicked.

You can also createe subdirectories to create submenus !

All this is read when AfterStep is launch & a temporary "startmenu" file is
created, so don't edit it since all your changes will be lost !

Since 1.4.3, you don't need to end the line by a carriage return, which made
AfterStep complain about the popup lacking an end spec or something.

1-3-B3) "desktop/backgrounds" directory : put there pictures you'd like to put
in the background, however XPM format is obligatory !

cp mypicture.xpm ~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/desktop/backgrounds

Then, restart AfterStep & open 'Start/Desktop/Background pictures' to change
screen background : your picture has been automatically added to Desktop menu.

Solid colors can also be put, just copy this example :
~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/desktop/backgrounds/black.xpm

1-3-B4) "desktop/buttons" directory : if you add your own window buttons here,
you will have to create a look file

1-3-B5) "desktop/icons" directory : if you add your own window icons here,
you will have to create a feel file

1-3-B6) "desktop/sounds" directory : if you add your own sounds here, you will
have to edit "modules" to configure Audio

1-3-B7) "desktop/feels/" & "desktop/looks" : see section below



2) New functions

Start menu is opened when you left click in the root window while right
clicking will open a list of all windows opened

2-1) look & feel files

"look" & "feel" files live in "desktop/looks" & "desktop/feels/"; they define
windows colors & reactions !

If you wish to create your own file, just refer to afterstep man page !

If you want to change AfterStep look without restart it, just select the look
of your choice in 'Start/Desktop/Looks/', in 2 seconds all windows will be
redrawn with that look & all modules will be restarted.

If you want to change AfterStep feel (ie the way it reacts), just do the same
with feel files !

NB : You can use diffent look & different feel files on different desktops,
however since this is very CPU hungry, it isn't defined by default !

Just edit configure.h & define DIFFERENTLOOKNFEELFOREACHDESKTOP !

NB2: But by default, you can use different pictures for each desktop, just
change them in 'Start/Desktop/Background picture', to add more options simply
put XPM pictures in "desktop/backgrounds" directory.

2-2) GetHelp

When you want to open a program manpage, just right click on left button !
Help program is defined in configure.h

2-3) Zap

When you want to change to next window with the less effort possible, just
type Alt-Tab or left click on left button !

2-4) Menu fonctions

To move a windows to another desktop (you can also drag in from the pager), to
resize it (...) just left click on second left button

2-5) Windows opened

To know which windows are opened, just right click on second left button.
You can also focus on a specific window clicking on it in this list !

2-6) Put in foreground / Put in background

Click on the titlebar to do this ; Alt-F11 will put current window on top af
all the others while Alt-F10 will put current window in the backgound of all
the others !

2-7) Iconify/Maximise

Iconifying a window is changing it to a little picture (with or without
background, edit configure.h to change this)

Left clicking/Right clicking on first right button will respectively do this !

2-8) Shade/Stick

Shading a window is hiding it behind its titlebar.
Sticking it is making the window follow you on any screen.

Left clicking/Right clicking on second right button will respectively do this !

2-9) Closing/Killing

Closing a window is ending a program normally.
Killing a window is closing a program which doesn't answer anylonger.

Left clicking/Right clicking on third right button will respectively do this !

2-10) Desktop saving

When you close AfterStep, all the windows still opened are saved in
~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/.windows, next time you start, AfterStep will
open them by himself !

Edit configure.h  & add NO_SAVEWINDOWS if you don't want that.

Module Save isn't doing the same : it writes desktop state in ~/.xinitrc
(default for each relauch), so for exemple :

* put "modules/Save/Save desktop into xinitrc" into
"~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/start/Modules/" & restart afterstep : this entry
is added into startmenu.

* open a clock, a biff, some programs you always want to have & run :
Modules/Save desktop into xinitrc

* close all this stuff FIRST, then afterstep & restart : it's back here !

* if you then reclose & restart AF, programs you've written in xinitrc will
also be written in ~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/.windows, therefore you should
ONLY USE afterstep default saving rather than Module Save's ugly one !


2-11) Start/Quit/Close this session

This will ask you wheter or not you want to close current session.

2-12) asapps

Many programs are included, like asclock, ascd ...

To run any, just click on 'Start/Application/StEP Applications'

NB : if you don't compile & install xiterm with XPM support, you won't be able
to run "X terminal (pixmap)" !

NB2: IF YOU WANT TO USE "pppchecker" TO CALL, DON'T FORGET TO CREATE ~/.ppprc ;
AN EXEMPLE IS INCLUDED IN applications/asppp/ppprc

NB3: If you're using bash & xiterm, try :
PS1='(\u@\h:\w)% \[\033]0;\w\007\]'
tcsh fans will use :
set prompt="%{\033]2;%n@%M:%/ - %l\007\033]1;%l@%m\007%}[%T] %B%m%b:%.02 %# "

And watch xiterm titlebar while you change directory ... very COOL !
